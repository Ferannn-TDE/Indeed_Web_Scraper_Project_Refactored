• Manage the full model lifecycle — from development through deployment, monitoring, retraining, and drift detection — ensuring production reliability.
• Apply fairness, bias mitigation, and explainability frameworks to ensure models are equitable and trustworthy.
• Use What-If scenario modeling and simulations to support clinical and business decision-making.
• Integrate engagement data into continuous feedback loops that refine model performance and responsiveness.
• Translate complex analyses into clear, compelling stories and insights for clinicians, engagement teams, executives, and community leaders.
• Develop dashboards, reports, and self-service analytics tools for use across CINQCARE teams.
• Partner with engineering teams for scalable deployment using modern MLOps practices.
• Collaborate cross-functionally with clinicians, engagement specialists, and leadership to ensure data science aligns with CINQCARE’s purpose and performance priorities.
• Research, test, and apply emerging methods (e.g., generative AI, causal inference, federated learning) relevant to community-based care and health equity.

Required Qualifications
• Master’s or PhD in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Economics, or related quantitative field; Bachelor’s with significant applied experience considered.
• Minimum 7 years of applied data science experience, ideally in healthcare, public health, insurance, or digital health.
